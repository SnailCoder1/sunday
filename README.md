Git Pong 

# A new Git test 8-)

## This new version comes with family.rb - a list of family members

Giving some Git-pong love to Stefan! Amazing to have active collaborators. :)

And here comes my reply! Hope you have a nice sunday evening SnailCoder1!

Morning mate! Went to work last and just came back home now... I have a quick follow-up with Thomas and then get some sleep for the demo later. 

We catch up soon and thanks for Git-poging!

P.S We should have a pair programming soon and train Ruby!
